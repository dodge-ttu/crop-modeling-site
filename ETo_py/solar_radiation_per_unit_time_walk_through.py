# This is a walk-through describing a method to calculate solar radiation for a given sub-day time
# interval. The method is documented on the FAO website for ETo calculation found at the link below:

# Notation and explanation has been taken directly from the link above.
#
# Extraterrestrial radiation for hourly or shorter periods (R_a)
#
# For hourly or shorter time periods the solar time angle at the beginning and end of the period
# the period should be considered when calculating R_a:
#
# R_a = (12(60) / œÄ) * G_sc * d_r * ( (œâ_2 - œâ_1) * sin(œÜ) * sin(ùõø) + cos(œÜ) + cos(ùõø) * (sin(œâ_2) - sin(œâ_1) )
#
# R_a: extraterrestrial radiation in the hour (or shorter) period [MJ m^-2 hour^-1]
# G_sc: solar constant = 0.0820 MJ m^-2 min^-1
# d_r: inverse relative distance Earth-Sun
# ùõø: solar declination (will be termed "little_delta" below)
# j: latitude in (j is œÜ but is denoted as j in the notes on the FAO link above)
# d: solar decimation
# œâ_1: solar time angle at beginning of period
# œâ_2: solar time angle at end of period

# Calculate inverse relative distance Earth-Sun
j = math.radians(33.576698)

# Calculate solar declination
little_delta = 0.409 * math.sin((((2*math.pi)/365)*j)-1.39)

# Calculate the solar time angle at the midpoint of the period.
#
# œâ = (œÄ/12) * ( t + ( 0.0667 * (L_z - L_m) + S_o) - 12 )
#
# t: standard clock time at the midpoint of the period (hour). For example for a period between 14.00 and 15.00 hours
#    the value for t 14.50
# L_z: longitude of the center of the local time zone (degrees west of Greenwich) -97.138451 for central US time zone. (Winnipeg, Canada)
# L_m: longitude of the measurement site -101.855072 for Lubbock TX
# S_c: seasonal correction for solar time

# The seasonal correction for solar time
#
# S_c = 0.1645 * sin(2*b) - 0.1255 * cos(b) - 0.025 * sin(b)
# b = ((2 * œÄ) * (day_of_year-81)) / 364

# Seasonal correction for solar time

S_c = 0.1645 * math.sin(2*b) - 0.1255 * math.cos(b) - 0.025 * math.sin(b)

# Solar time angle at the midpoint of the period
# Because the met data I'm harvesting is collected every thirty minutes I need a function to return the current
# time rounded to the 15 minutes or 45 minutes depending on weather the current time is above or below the half hour
# mark.

# From the estimation of extraterrestrial solar radiation (R_a) the amount of solar radiation that enters the Earth's
# atmosphere (Rs) can be calculated with the Angstrom formula which relates solar radiatoin to extraterrestrial
# radiation.
#
# R_s = (a_s + b_s(n/N)) * R_a
#
# R_s: solar or shortwave radiation [MJ m^-2 given_time_period^-1]
# n: actual duration of sunshine [hour as float]
# N: maximum possible duration of sunshine [hour as float]
# n/N: relative sunshine duration []
# R_a: extraterrestrial radiation [MJ m^-2 given_time_period^-1]
# a_s: regression constant, expressing the fraction of extraterrestrial radiation reaching Earth on overcast days (n=0)
# a_s + b_s: fraction of extraterrestrial radiation reaching the earth on clear days (n=N)
#
# Where no actual solar radiation data are available and no calibration has been carried out for improved a_s and b_s
# parameters, the values a_s = 0.25 and b_s = 0.50 are recommended.
#
# Because the data we are collecting is on a sub-day (30 minute) time span we will use n/N=for this calculation.

# Calculate solar radiation
n=1
N=1
a_s = 0.25
b_s = 0.5
R_s = (a_s + (b_s*(n/N))) * R_a

# The calculation of clear-sky solar radiation (R_so) is required for computing net longwave radiation.
#
# For near sea level or when calibrated values for a_s and b_s are not available:
#
# R_so = (a_s + b_s) * R_a
#
# R_so: clear-sky solar radiation [MJ m^-2 given_time_period^-1]
# a_s + b_s: fraction of extraterrestrial radiation reaching the earth on clear-sky days (n=N)
#
# When calibrated values for a_s and b_s are not available:
#
# R_so = (0.75 + 2E-5 * z) * R_a
#
# z: location elevation above sea level [meters] 976 meters for Lubbock, TX

# Calculate clear-sky radiation
z = 976
R_so = (0.75 * ((2E-5)*z)) * R_a

# Net solar or net shortwave radiation (R_ns) is the net shortwave radiation resulting from the balance between
# incoming and reflected solar radiation. This is estimated with:
#
# R_ns = (1-a) * R_s
#
# R_ns: net solar or shortwave radiation
# a: albedo or canopy reflection coefficient, which is 0.23 for the hypothetical grass reference crop [dimensionless]
# R_s: the incoming solar radiation [MJ m^-2 given_time_period^-2]

# Calculate net solar shortwave radiation
albedo = 0.23
R_ns = (1-albedo) * R_s

# Net longwave radiation (R_nl) must be calculated. The rate
